Here's a short list of things we can do:

- Kernel
  - Add the copy assignable traits
  - Add the move constructible traits
  - Add the move assignable traits
- Userspace (vle::Dynamics, vle::Executive, vle::NetworkDynamics, vle::Port):
  - How to provide several simulation algorithms?
  - Add a global identifier (size_t and/or std::string): size_t may be usefull
    with PRNG but std::string for observationâ€¦
  - Add an observation function, but when call it ? We can provide several
    methods: timed (at the end of the simulation or following a time step) and
    event (when a model produce an output).
  - Add feature to avoid update of the scheduller in transition function.
- Project
  - Cleanup unit test.
  - Cleanup and simplify autotools scripts.
