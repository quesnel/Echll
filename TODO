Here's a short list of things we can do
---------------------------------------

- Kernel (to clone simulation / build sub-simulation)
  - Add the copy assignable traits
  - Add the move constructible traits
  - Add the move assignable traits

- Engine
  - Add a **parallel_dsde** that use `std::thread` in transition
    function.
  - Add a **dtss** engine.
  - How to provide several simulation algorithms?
  - Add a global identifier (`size_t` and/or `std::string`): `size_t`
    may be useful with PRNG but std::string for observationâ€¦
  - Add an observation function, but when call it ? We can provide
    several methods: timed (at the end of the simulation or following
    a time step) and event (when a model produce an output).
  - Add feature to avoid update of the scheduler in transition function.

- Project
  - Cleanup unit test.
  - Cleanup and simplify autotools scripts.
  - Add a manager mode
  - Add a new vpz format

- Utils
  - Add the package system as in VLE > 1.1
    - Add a spawn system
    - Add a clean API path access to the package
  - Add the module system as in VLE > 1.1
    - Add the module system
    - Add a clean API module access to the environment
