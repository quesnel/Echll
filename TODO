Here's a short list of things we can do:

- Kernel

  - How to copy vle::Dynamics, vle::NetworkDynamics and vle::Executive? To avoid
    segfault.

- Userspace (vle::Dynamics, vle::Executive, vle::NetworkDynamics):

  - How to provide several simulation algorithms?

  - Add a global identifier (size_t and/or std::string): size_t may be usefull
    with PRNG but std::string for observationâ€¦

  - Add an observation function, but when call it ? We can provide several
    methods: timed (at the end of the simulation or following a time step) and
    event (when a model produce an output).

- Synchronizer

  - Add the possibility to clone a simulation to produce recursive simulation.
    Perhaps, just use to copy constructor of the Synchronizer, NetworkSimulator,
    ExecutiveSimulator and Simulator or just for userspace objects?

- Project

  - Cleanup unit test.
  - Cleanup and simplify autotools scripts.
