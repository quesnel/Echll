Here's a short list of things we can do:

- Values

  - Add static constant expression for Value ?
  - Add management of pointer in Value? How manage delete of pointer? May be in
    specialized template. But when calling the destructor ? Perhaps a best
    practice is to use a std::shared_ptr ?

- Simulator

  - Add an observation function, but when call it ? We can provide several
    methods: timed (at the end of the simulation or following a time step) and
    event (when a model produce an output).

- NetworkSimulator

  - Manage hierarchy of NetworkSimulator in NetworkSimulator.

- Synchronizer

  - Add the possibility to clone a simulation to produce recursive simulation.
    Perhaps, just use to copy constructor of the Synchronizer, NetworkSimulator
    and Simulator ?

- Project

  - Cleanup unit test.
